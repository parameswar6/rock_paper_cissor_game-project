‚úä Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a simple, classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game you can play right in your web browser. The whole game is just one file, making it a great little project for anyone learning web development. It's a fun way to play against the computer and see how some basic code works.

‚ú® Cool Stuff About This Game
Easy to Play: You just click one of three buttons to make your move.

Play Against the Computer: The computer picks its move randomly, so you'll never know what it's going to do next.

Instant Results: A little message pops up right away to tell you if you won, lost, or tied.

‚öôÔ∏è How It's Made
This project uses the two main parts of a simple website:

HTML: This is the basic structure. It's like the skeleton of the game, with the words "Rock Paper Scissors" and the three buttons you click.

JavaScript: This is the brains of the game. It handles all the action.

It figures out what move the computer should make.

It checks your move and the computer's move to see who won.

It tells you the result in a little pop-up window.

üöÄ How to Play
It's super easy to get started. Just open the index.html file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). That's it! There's nothing else to install or set up.
